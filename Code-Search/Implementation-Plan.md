### Plan

#### Reference Project

https://github.com/zeeshaanahmad/url-shortener
https://github.com/in28minutes/spring-boot-examples/tree/master/spring-boot-rest-services
https://github.com/SuhasKamate/Business_Management_Project

#### Plan
Take
https://github.com/zeeshaanahmad/url-shortener

Step : Use com.github.javaparser to split the classes and methods (imports should be part of the classes)
Write them as a separate file , with possible meta data
Step : Read these files, use voyage-code-3,text-embedding-3-large and then store in VectorDB
Step : For Vector DB, install in the on prem instance
Step : run through free text query to see which one gives good results

Based on this expand to other examples, better tagging, etc
