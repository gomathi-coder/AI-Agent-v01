## User Query

I want to create a backend service that indexes codebase and then use it for natural language user query to semantic search on the code base.
This is specifically for the java project in the MVP version.

Examples:

Query: “Where is checkout tax and shipping calculated?” or “calculate order total with tax and shipping”
System : <Should respond with top x matches of code snippet for this user query>

Query: “Where do we handle ‘payment declined’ errors?” or  “payment declined exception mapping to HTTP 402”
System : <Should respond with top x matches of code snippet for this user query>

These are just few of the examples to show how the query will be given in the natural language and the expectation

The modules will be
Service 1 : Indexing Service
Service 2 : Query Service

For the Service 1 : Indexing Service.
This the step by step algorithm.

Get the project code base root folder.
Scan the entire folder structures.
Consider only files of type .java, .xml, .properties.
For each of the file type, we need to run through the parsers.
Let us consider the parser for java.
use treespitter parser.
get the imports and mark as :file-content-import
get the class definition and mark :class-definition
get the method definition and implementation as mark as :method-definition
A file can have multiple classes and a class can have multiple methods
dont consider any block comments
all this data will be stored in vector database

Few questions I have. Let us use this as brainstorming session. so didnt give any code snippet, give ideas, options, pros and cons of the each of the design considerations

Is treespitter is a good choice for java parser ?
What is the ideal size for each vector records ? can we get this definition as number of words or charachter or tokens ?
A method will be large size, how to split the method semantically correct ? what are the options and algorithms for it ?
For sure we need to extract more information from the code and have to store it. This will help in better search. So what all options we have to extract this information. One idea is to have a program flow extracted. the other option is extract the code summary, the other option is extract the tags or extract the business rules, etc.
It is important for us to understand what all such content we can extract from the code and then store it
Also for each vector what other information we need to store ? like class name, method name, path , etc? list them down
Do we need to have relationship maintained, example methods will be split, so all methods linked to method definition, methods chunks are sequenced, methods linked to class, classes linked to packages, etc ?

These are some of the algorithm or design things I have in mind.
You also list down what other things we need to consider.


The idea here is always to use vector search on the code, vector search on the text content, lexical search on the text content. or anything else ?
Also let us not spend our effort on the reranking or etc, That will be brainstormed as second pass.

lets start now

## Response

Great problem to work on. Below is a structured brainstorming of design choices for a Java-focused MVP that indexes a codebase and answers natural language questions with relevant code snippets.

High-level shape of the solution

Service 1: Indexing Service
Walk repo, parse code and configs, produce chunks, enrich with metadata and relationships, compute embeddings, push to vector store and a secondary store for metadata/graph.
Service 2: Query Service
Take NL query, do hybrid retrieval (vector on code + lexical on code and text + optionally structure-aware filters), return top-k snippets with their context (class/method/file), optionally include neighboring chunks in the same method.
Answering your specific questions and related options

Is Tree-sitter a good choice for a Java parser?
Yes for fast, robust syntactic parsing and language-agnostic extensibility.

Pros:
Very fast, incremental parsing, tolerant of errors.
Stable AST for most languages, enabling uniform multi-language strategy later.
Great for chunking by syntactic units (class, method, block).
Cons:
No semantic/type resolution, no symbol binding, no control/data flow out of the box.
For deeper analysis (call graph, find references, resolve imports), you need additional tooling.
Alternatives and when to consider them:

JavaParser (com.github.javaparser):
Pros: Good Java support; can resolve symbols with symbol solver; easy to use; pure Java.
Cons: Heavier than Tree-sitter; symbol resolution can be slow or need full classpath configuration.
Eclipse JDT / Spoon:
Pros: Industrial-strength semantic analysis, type resolution, AST rewrites, code metrics, control-flow.
Cons: Steeper learning curve; heavier; more ops/maintenance for a simple MVP.
Recommendation for MVP:
Use Tree-sitter for parsing and chunking; supplement with lightweight heuristics for imports and signatures.
If you need call graphs or accurate references soon, add JavaParser’s symbol solver or Spoon in a second phase (run in a separate enrichment pass so MVP stays simple).
2. Ideal size for each vector record (words/characters/tokens)?

Embedding models measure in tokens; chunk to a target token budget.
Working ranges:
150–350 tokens per chunk for code is a sweet spot for retrieval granularity vs context.
Cap chunks at 512 tokens when using general-purpose embeddings; many models perform well up to that size.
For dense methods, prefer small blocks (100–200 tokens) plus overlap.
Why not very large?
Big chunks dilute signal and reduce precision; retrieval tends to pull in noisy neighbors.
Why not very small?
Too fine-grained loses context; increases number of chunks; can hurt recall.
Practical guidance:
Compute tokens using the tokenizer of your embedding model.
Use a tiered strategy:
Method-level summary chunk (<= 256 tokens).
One or more body chunks (150–250 tokens each, with 10–15% overlap and a repeated header).
Class-level summary chunk.
Store both method-level and block-level chunks for flexible retrieval.
3. Splitting large methods semantically: options and algorithms

AST-based block chunking:
Split at top-level statements/blocks (if/else, loops, try/catch), preserve braces, never break a statement.
Keep signature + Javadoc (if allowed) + imports as a fixed header in each chunk for context.
Pros: Semantically coherent, minimizes cut points inside logical units.
Cons: Uneven chunk sizes; still might exceed target size.
Statement grouping with size budget:
Traverse method body, accumulate statements until size budget is hit; break on safe boundaries (blank lines, block ends).
Pros: Predictable sizes, easy to implement.
Cons: Might split a conceptual unit.
Sliding window with overlap on tokens:
Tokenize and create windows of N tokens with M-token overlap; include method signature as prefix.
Pros: Simple and robust; good recall.
Cons: Can create redundant chunks; increased storage.
Hybrid:
First try AST block boundaries; if a block is still too big, fall back to sliding windows within that block.
Extra heuristics:
Avoid splitting across try/catch boundaries and switch/case groups.
Keep throw/return lines with their preceding logic.
Maintain sequence order metadata for later reconstruction.
4. What additional information to extract and store to improve search?
Think of layers: lexical, syntactic, semantic, behavioral.

Lexical/signature layer:
Package, imports, annotations, class/interface/enum name, extends/implements, method signature (modifiers, return type, name, parameters, annotations, throws).
Field declarations and constants.
String literals and error messages (critical for queries like “payment declined”).
HTTP mappings (Spring @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @ResponseStatus) and status codes (e.g., HttpStatus.PAYMENT_REQUIRED).
Configuration keys from .properties and .yaml (if you decide to include YAML later) and XML config.
Pros: Great for keyword and symbol search; easy filters.
Structural layer:
Containment relationships: package → file → class → method → block → statement.
Cross-references: import usage, method calls, field accesses.
Classpath/library references (optional initially).
Semantic layer (MVP-lite, then advanced later):
Function summaries: what the method does, inputs/outputs, side effects, domain concepts (can use an LLM in an offline batch, if allowed).
Business rule tags: detect domain phrases and flags (e.g., “tax”, “shipping”, “discount”, “payment”, “retry”, “idempotent”).
Exception behavior: thrown exceptions, caught exceptions; map to HTTP codes or error enums.
Persistence operations (SQL, repository calls), external API calls (HTTP clients), messaging (Kafka topics, queues).
Authorization checks (e.g., @PreAuthorize, custom security filters).
Program flow (basic control-flow summaries): e.g., “validates X; computes tax via TaxService; adds shipping via ShippingCalculator; returns BigDecimal total”.
Note: Rich program flow graphs and precise type flow require heavier tooling (JDT/Spoon). For MVP, simple heuristics on call sites and exception handling go a long way.
Text derived layer:
Auto-generated “chunk synopsis” and “method synopsis” (one-liner and 3–5 bullet points).
Embedding text field should combine: signature + important identifiers + string literals + annotations + a compact synopsis.
5. What metadata to store with each vector record?

Identifiers:
repo id, commit hash or version tag, file path, package name, class name, method name, method signature hash (stable id), chunk id (stable via content hash).
Location:
start/end line numbers, byte offsets, method start/end lines, chunk sequence index within the method.
Structural:
parent ids (method id, class id), sibling/prev/next chunk ids, children ids if you use nested chunks.
Type info (lightweight):
return type, param types, thrown exceptions (as text), annotations (e.g., @Transactional, @ResponseStatus).
Domain tags:
keywords detected (payment, tax, shipping), HTTP status codes, exception types, repository/entity names, feature flags.
Search helpers:
language = java/xml/properties, file kind (test vs main), module name (e.g., Maven module), framework (detected Spring, JAX-RS).
Scores and timestamps:
last indexed at, model version used, tokenizer version, size stats (token count).
Text fields for lexical search:
raw snippet text, normalized tokens (camelCase split), normalized string literals, and optionally a “no-comments” version as you requested.
Optional provenance:
blame info (author, last modified) if available; useful for prioritizing active code.
6. Do we need to maintain relationships?

Yes. Relationships enable better filtering, context stitching, and explanations.
Chunk → Method → Class → Package containment.
Chunk sequence order within a method.
Method-to-method call edges (even if approximate) and method-to-exception edges.
Method ↔ URL mappings (controller routes), HTTP status mappings.
Class → imports and references to dependency classes.
File ↔ related config entries (e.g., property keys referenced by @Value).
Storage options:
Keep relationships in a document/relational store or a lightweight graph store.
For MVP, JSON columns in Postgres or a doc store works; later, a graph DB (Neo4j) if you need path queries.
Why it matters:
Lets you return the full method when a small chunk hits.
Enables showing neighboring code and call sites.
Supports lineage queries like “where is 402 set” → controller method → service → exception type.
7. Ideal search modalities

Hybrid is best for code.
Vector search on code chunks (embeddings tuned for code + NL).
Lexical search on code and strings (BM25/KNN on Lucene/Elasticsearch/OpenSearch).
Structure-aware filters using metadata (e.g., only @Controller classes, only methods that throw PaymentDeclinedException).
Optional matchers:
Symbol search (exact name matches for types/methods).
Regex search (useful fallback for power users; you can hide it from MVP UI but keep internally).
Fusion for MVP:
Even without reranking, you can merge candidate sets from vector and lexical and sort by a simple weighted score plus recency or file importance.
Keep it simple now; plan reranking (cross-encoder) in phase two.
8. Handling .xml and .properties in MVP

.properties:
Parse key=value; index both; especially messages or error strings (payment declined).
Keep module/file path to correlate with Java code that references these keys.
.xml:
Maven pom.xml: artifact ids, modules, dependency hints for domain names.
Spring XML configurations (if present): bean names, class references, property wiring.
Web.xml or framework configs: servlet/filter mappings, error pages, security constraints.
Index string content for lexical and vector search; tag files with their roles.
9. Dealing with comments

You said “don’t consider any block comments.”
Pros: Less noise; focus on code truth.
Cons: You lose Javadoc, which can encode business terms used by NL queries.
Compromise:
Exclude block comments from code embeddings, but optionally index Javadoc into a separate “doc” field or separate vector namespace. You can choose to include/exclude this source in queries via a toggle.
10. Embedding model choices

Use a code-aware embedding model that supports both NL query and code snippet embedding.
Options: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large/small (strong general baseline), Voyage code-focused models, Cohere embed-v3, Jina code embeddings, or open-source (e5-code variants) if self-hosting.
Considerations:
Code vs NL duality: ensure the model is trained for text-code similarity.
Token limits and cost: watch throughput and price.
Latency: precompute embeddings offline; query-time only embed user query.
Plan for evaluation: try two models and run a small relevance test set from your codebase.
11. Vector database choices

Managed: Pinecone, Weaviate Cloud.
Open-source/self-hosted: Qdrant, Milvus, Weaviate OSS, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch KNN, Postgres pgvector.
Considerations:
Hybrid support (text + vector) and metadata filters.
Operational complexity and cost.
For MVP: Qdrant or pgvector if you want simplicity and control; or Pinecone for managed ease.
12. Chunking strategy details for MVP

Create multiple layers:
File-level summary chunk (for broad recall).
Class-level summary chunk.
Method-level summary chunk.
Method body chunks (150–250 tokens) with 10–15% overlap, AST-aware splitting where possible.
Each chunk gets:
Header: package, imports (top N important), class signature, method signature.
Body: code slice without block comments.
Auxiliary: string literals and annotations appended in a minimal normalized list.
Precomputed synopsis (1–2 sentences) if you allow AI summarization offline.
13. Answering your example queries with this design

“Where is checkout tax and shipping calculated?”:
Vector search hits method summaries and chunks mentioning tax/shipping, ShippingService, TaxCalculator, etc.
Lexical search picks up “tax”, “shipping”, “calculateTotal”, “BigDecimal”, “applyTax”.
Metadata filter can favor classes under checkout or order packages.
Graph can pull neighboring service methods or call sites to show context.
“Where do we handle ‘payment declined’ errors?” or “payment declined exception mapping to HTTP 402”:
String literals and message bundles (.properties) are critical; lexical search will find the exact phrase.
Vector search can match to exception class names and controller advice that maps exceptions to status codes.
Filter on @ResponseStatus or exception handlers (@ExceptionHandler).
If you build an exception mapping index, you can directly show which handler maps to 402.
14. Incremental indexing and stability

Use content hashes for chunks so you only re-embed changed content.
Keep a stable method id based on signature and file path; chunk ids based on method id + sequence + content hash.
On code changes:
Reparse only changed files, re-chunk methods, update embeddings and relationships.
Watchers:
Support both one-shot (CI) indexing and daemon mode for local dev repos.
15. How to choose “top X” snippet shape to return

Return the chunk plus:
Method signature and a short synopsis.
A link to the file path and line numbers.
Optionally previous/next chunk if the hit is mid-method.
Let users toggle “expand to full method” or “show call sites”.
16. Additional considerations to put on your radar

Tokenization variance across models; store tokenized length to avoid surprises.
Language detection for multi-module repos; even though MVP is Java, some support code may be Kotlin or Groovy.
Minimize duplicated content (generated code); optionally ignore build/target dirs and vendor code.
Tests:
Allow toggling inclusion of tests; sometimes queries want business logic, sometimes unit examples help discoverability.
Privacy/compliance and licenses; ensure no external uploads of proprietary code unless permitted.
Evaluation:
Build a small labeled set of 20–50 questions tailored to your repo; measure hit rate@k and MRR; iterate on chunking and metadata.
Observability:
Log query → retrieved chunk ids/scores, time taken, which retrievers contributed; keep a feedback loop.
Domain vocabulary:
Maintain a custom synonym dictionary: tax = VAT = GST; payment declined ~ authorization failed; HTTP 402 ~ payment required.
Expand queries with synonyms at retrieval time.
17. A proposal for an MVP plan

Phase 0: Data model
Decide chunk schema, relationships, and minimal metadata.
Phase 1: Indexer
Repo scanning, ignore rules, Tree-sitter parse, chunking, metadata extraction, embeddings, vector + metadata store.
Parsers for .properties and .xml (basic).
Phase 2: Query service
Embed query; hybrid retrieval: vector + BM25; simple fusion; return top-k with context.
Minimal filters (language=java, path includes “controller” or “service”).
Phase 3: Enrichment
Lightweight exception mapping, HTTP status extraction, string literal catalog, controller route index.
Optional: offline method summaries.
Phase 4: Optional semantic links
Approximate call graph via static heuristics (method invocation extraction) or integrate JavaParser for symbol resolution.
18. Tradeoffs recap

Tree-sitter vs heavy analyzers:
Start with Tree-sitter for speed and portability; augment only if you need deep semantics.
Chunk size:
Start with 150–300 token chunks plus method summaries; tune based on eval.
Comments:
Exclude block comments from code embeddings; optionally index Javadoc separately.
Storage:
Start with one vector DB and one metadata store; add graph store only if needed.
Search:
Hybrid retrieval from day one; reranking can wait.
Open questions worth clarifying before you build

Are we allowed to use LLMs offline to generate summaries and tags? If not, stick to rule-based signals.
How large are target repos and how often do they change? Determines index update strategy and cost constraints.
Do we need multi-repo search? If yes, add repo id and version control metadata early.
Are we strictly excluding all block comments, including Javadoc? If yes, we should compensate via summaries or identifiers and strings.
Any frameworks we can lean on (e.g., Spring)? If yes, add framework-specific extractors for better precision.
If you want, we can next outline concrete schemas for chunk records and relationship edges, list candidate embedding models with pros/cons for Java code, and define an initial evaluation protocol tailored to your example queries.
