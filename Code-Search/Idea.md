#### Considering embedding models for code

I need to help the user who wants to take Spring Boot Java code and chunk it into a vector database. They're looking for an effective embedding model that preserves code semantics for search. For their needs, I’ll suggest models like OpenAI's "text-embedding-3-large" and "text-embedding-3-small" since the former is known for strong performance on code. I should also consider other options like "Voyage AI" models or those from Cohere for multilingual capabilities.

#### Exploring embedding options

I'm considering various embedding models that could work for code. Cohere's "embed-v3" is noteworthy since it specializes in retrieval, including code, and has capabilities for different input types. Jina AI also has options like "jina-embeddings-v3," which supports code. There’s also Nomic's embeddings for longer contexts. Mixedbread offers "mxbai-embed-large," which is good for code tasks too. I wonder if CodeBERTa and GraphcodeBERT could be relevant here as well. So many choices to weigh!

#### Evaluating code embeddings

I'm thinking about various embedding models suited for code search. While "CodeBERT" is an option, it's not as effective as some newer models. "SentenceTransformers" models, like "all-MiniLM-L6-v2," aren't specifically optimized for code. OpenAI's "text-embedding-3-large" is recommended for its 3,000 dimensions, supporting both code and text semantics. Voyage AI's "voyage-code-2" is specialized for code retrieval and has 1,536 dimensions. I want to highlight that "voyage-code-2" is available as of October 2024, focusing on effective code retrieval!

#### Advising on chunking strategies for code

I need to provide guidance on how to chunk code effectively. Chunking by syntactic units like classes, methods, and files is key, avoiding fixed-token windows that don’t maintain context. I should suggest keeping chunk sizes around 200-400 tokens for functions while ensuring better semantics by chunking at the function or method level. Including documentation and comments can help. For queries, options like cross encoders, rerankers from Cohere or Voyage, and hybrid search methods should be considered. It sounds like there's a solid pipeline to propose!

#### Structuring a code embedding proposal

I'm outlining a structured approach for embedding code effectively. First, I’ll parse the repository for AST nodes like classes and methods. Then, I need to generate content for each method, including headers and JavaDocs, while keeping token limits in mind. Then I’ll compute embeddings and store them in a vector database with relevant metadata. For querying, it’s important to rewrite queries to include different synonyms. I'll suggest using dimensional embeddings, retrieval strategies, and maintain chunk sizes, as well as cost considerations for various models like "voyage-code-2" and OpenAI's embeddings!

#### Recommending code embedding models

I'm suggesting some top choices for code embedding models based on their performance and suitability. For code search tasks, VoyageAI's voyage-code-2 is ideal, followed by OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large for general purposes. Jina’s open-source options are good for on-prem needs and Mixedbread offers a solid open-source API choice. I need to emphasize chunking strategies like method-level chunks and including relevant metadata. Also, incorporating both code and natural language summaries can enhance query results. Finally, I’ll ask clarifying questions regarding user constraints for tailored recommendations!

#### Recommending code embedding models

For the best semantic fidelity in code search, I recommend Voyage AI's voyage-code-2. If you're looking for a more mainstream option, OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large is a solid choice. For self-hosted solutions, consider Jina Code or mxbai. Reranking is essential, so look into models like Cohere Rerank-3 or Jina Reranker.

For chunking, use AST parsing to create method/class chunks, keeping summaries embedded for better query results. Evaluate the performance with 30-50 queries, focusing on return on investment.
